      # Privacy Policy
      Data protection is important to me. This Privacy Policy explains how personal data is collected, used, and protected when you use the website cloudbuds.de.

      ## Controller and Contact
      Jannik Adam  
      c/o res‑ebert GmbH & Co. KG  
      Festplatz 9, 76137 Karlsruhe, Germany  
      E‑Mail: info@cloudbuds.de  

      ## Legal Basis & Purpose of Processing
      Server host logs (IP address, browser user agent, access timestamp, referrer URL, HTTP status):  
      Processed for security, debugging, and to ensure the website’s proper operation.  
      Legal basis: Legitimate interests under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. (Collecting such access logs is necessary for the service’s security and functionality, which constitutes a legitimate interest. This information is provided in compliance with GDPR’s transparency requirements in Art. 12–13.)  

      Contact form submissions (name, email address, message text):  
      Processed in order to handle and respond to inquiries or requests you submit via the form.  
      Legal basis: Depending on the context of your message, either (a) steps preparatory to or for performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) – for example, if you contact me to inquire about services – or (b) my legitimate interest in answering your inquiry (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). In either case, the processing is necessary to respond to your communication.  

      ## Hosting & Transfers to the USA
      This website is hosted by Netlify, Inc. in the United States. I have concluded a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Netlify pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR, which contractually ensures that your data is handled according to GDPR standards. Because Netlify’s servers are located in the U.S., personal data (such as the logs and form submissions mentioned above) may be transferred to and stored on servers in the United States. Netlify, Inc. is certified under the EU–US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), providing an approved safeguard for EU-to-US data transfers. Where necessary, Netlify also employs Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as an additional transfer mechanism. These measures ensure that your personal data enjoys a level of protection in the U.S. equivalent to EU standards.

      ## Categories of Data and Recipients
      Categories of personal data processed:  
      Server/traffic data:  
      IP address, browser and device information (user agent), access times, referrer URL, and HTTP status codes (from access logs).  

      Contact form data:  
      Name, email address, and the message content you provide in the contact form.  

      Recipients of the data:  
      Your personal data is handled confidentially. It is primarily processed by myself as the website operator. In addition, data is processed by Netlify as a service provider (data processor) acting on my behalf to host the site and manage form submissions. I do not share your personal data with any other third parties for any marketing or unrelated purposes. Netlify is contractually bound via the DPA to process data only under my instructions and to maintain strict data security. (Netlify may engage certain sub-processors for specific functions, for example using an automated spam-filtering service Akismet to screen form submissions, but this is solely within the scope of Netlify’s processing on my behalf and not an independent third-party use of your data.)  

      ## Storage Duration
      I adhere to the principle of data minimization. Personal data is only stored for as long as needed for the purposes outlined above:  

      Server logs: Automatically anonymized or deleted after a maximum of 90 days. (This retention period is to allow review in case of security incidents or technical issues, after which the raw log data is purged or stripped of identifying information.)  

      Contact form submissions: Stored for up to 6 months from receipt. This allows me to manage ongoing correspondence. If our communication is still active (e.g. an email thread or a project discussion stemming from your inquiry), I may retain the relevant correspondence longer until it is concluded. Once no longer needed, your message data will be deleted.  

      ## Your Rights (GDPR Art. 15–21)
      Under the GDPR, you have several rights regarding your personal data. Subject to the conditions and exceptions set out in the law, you have the right to:  

      - Access the personal data I hold about you (Art. 15 GDPR).  
      - Rectification of inaccurate data, and to have incomplete data completed (Art. 16 GDPR).  
      - Erasure of your personal data (the “right to be forgotten,” Art. 17 GDPR), for example if the data are no longer necessary or were processed unlawfully.  
      - Restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR) under certain conditions, e.g. while a dispute about data accuracy or processing legality is resolved.  
      - Data portability (Art. 20 GDPR) – to receive the personal data you provided in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or to request I transmit it to another controller when applicable.  
      - Object to processing of your data (Art. 21 GDPR) when the processing is based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. I will then stop processing your data unless compelling legitimate grounds override your interests, or if it’s needed for legal claims.  
      - Withdraw consent at any time (if any processing is based on your consent, Art. 7(3) GDPR). Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing done before the withdrawal.  
      - Lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR) if you believe my processing of your data violates data protection laws. You can do so in the EU Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or where an alleged infringement occurred.  

      You can exercise your rights at any time by contacting me via email at info@cloudbuds.de or by mail at the postal address provided above. I will respond to your request as soon as possible, generally within one month as mandated by GDPR.  

      ## SSL/TLS Encryption
      For security reasons and to protect the transmission of sensitive content, this site employs SSL/TLS encryption. All data that you send via the website (for example, through the contact form) is transmitted over an HTTPS connection. This encryption prevents third parties from intercepting your data in transit. These technical and organizational security measures are implemented in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR to safeguard your personal data.  

      ## Use of Cookies
      This website does not use any tracking cookies or third-party analytics. Thus, you generally won’t encounter cookies from our site. If any essential cookies are ever needed for the site to function, they would be used solely for that functional purpose, and not for tracking. You are able to configure your web browser to refuse or delete cookies as you wish. Most browsers allow you to block all cookies or to notify you before a cookie is stored. Please note that if in the future any features requiring cookies are added and you block cookies entirely, some site functionality might be affected. However, at present, blocking cookies should not affect your experience on cloudbuds.de.  

      ## Contact Form and Consent
      The contact form on this site is entirely optional to use. A clear link to this Privacy Policy is provided near the contact form. By submitting an inquiry through the form, you confirm that you have read and accept this Privacy Policy and consent to the processing of the provided data for the purpose of handling your request. If you prefer not to use the contact form, you can always reach out via the email address provided. In either case, your data will be used only to process your inquiry.

      ## Updates and Effective Date
      This Privacy Policy is effective as of 03 August 2025. I may update or revise this Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the website or legal requirements. If there are material changes, I will post the updated policy here on this page (and if substantial, I may also notify users by other means). The latest revision date will be indicated at the top of the policy. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how I protect your data. Should you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the handling of your data, please feel free to contact me at the email or address provided above. Your trust is important, and I will gladly clarify any points as needed.
